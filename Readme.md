# CEC.Blazor.Core

This library contains the core components for life without routing.

The Router is replaced by a View Manager.

You can see the View Manager in action on [the AllinOne project](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/AllinOne), and described [here](https://github.com/ShaunCurtis/AllinOne/blob/master/All-In-One-World-Blazor.md).
